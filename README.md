# Calc.c Format.c
Samuel Cutler
Fall 2016

  Again a great assignment. I poured a lot of energy into creating calc.c to work with Arbitrary length and multiplication. I have tested it and so far all the values have been correct compared to Wolfram Alpha. I ran into "10 Bus Erros" when I tried to implement an exponential function by making recursive multiplication. I tried to add some more comments, but found that I did not have proper time to comment all the code. If there are any questions about methods or formatting let me know. 
  
  I learned how to create a makefile which was a little weird, but not difficult if I have it right. My program mostly operates on the level of O(n) as all the functions only use char*
